### Explication
**Eulerian Path**: An Eulerian path in a graph is a path that visits every edge exactly once. A graph has an Eulerian path if and only if exactly zero or two vertices have odd degree.

**Hamiltonian Path**: A Hamiltonian path in a graph is a path that visits every vertex exactly once. There is no simple criterion like Euler's for determining the existence of a Hamiltonian path; it is known to be an NP-complete problem.
